# The Accessible and Accelerated Robotics Lab (A²R Lab)

<img align="left" src="/profile/a2r.png" alt="A2R-Lab Logo">

The A²R Lab focusses on focuses on **optimizing robotic systems at all scales** by developing, optimizing, implementing, and evaluating next-generation algorithms and edge computational systems, through algorithm-hardware-software co-design (e.g., [MPCGPU](https://a2r-lab.org/publication/mpcgpu/), [GRiD](https://a2r-lab.org/publication/grid/), [TinyMPC](https://a2r-lab.org/publication/tinympc/)). As such, our research is at the intersection of Robotics and Computer Architecture, Embedded Systems, Numerical Optimization, and Machine Learning.

We also want to **promote a responsible, sustainable, and accessible future for robotics and edge computing**, including the development of new interdisciplinary, project-based, open-access courses that lower the barriers to entry for cutting-edge topics like robotics, parallel programming, and embedded machine learning (e.g., [Global TinyML Education](https://a2r-lab.org/publication/scalingtinyml4d/), [Parallel Optimization for Robotics](https://a2r-lab.org/publication/paroptrobcourse/)).
